    He's been doing Ruby/Rails development over the past five years with some
    experience of development with Go. He started using Vim just when he
    started his professional carrier, and is still learning to master Vim.
    While most of the time he uses Vim for application development, sometimes
    he does system administration work, and Vim really helps him to achieve
    goals efficiently. He thinks Vim is a daily power tools for every type of
    developer.
