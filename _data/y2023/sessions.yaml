    When developing a Vim plugin, Vim script is a primary language. However, for a plugin that's heavily involved with the target language, there's a case where Vim script is not enough. Luckily, Vim enables us to develop a plugin with the same language as the target. In this talk, I'll show how to develop a Vim plugin that works with RSpec using Ruby. I'll also provide a case where LSP is not the best tool.
