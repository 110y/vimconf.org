    Although it may not be well known, Vim has a lot of useful standard features and many people use them from the plugin, but they can also be used directly.
    Certainly plugins are important for efficient use of Vim and have used many plugins so far, but I prefer standard features rather than plugins recently.
    In this session, I'll talk about specific method of migrating plugins to standard features, along with my own growth and changes in usage of Vim itself which is that reason.

    Discover what is happening internally when you switch modes, such as insert mode, normal mode, and operator-pending mode.
    This talk first revisits how modes are when you use Vim, then I'll let you dive into the Vim C implementation to see what's exactly happening there.
    I'll even show what modifications can be done when you make change, with using existing pull requests.

    This talk is both for Vim beginners and advanced users who don't always look at the Vim C implementation.
