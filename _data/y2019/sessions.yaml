    The objectives of this talk are to increase your productive with Vim, to
    talk a way for you to like your vimrc and a way for you to go forward to
    next vimrc from vimrc build on many copy-and-past. I have been using Vim
    for about 7 years. The talk is composed of two parts by my viewpoint. The
    first part describes how to glow your vimrc. As you know Vim is so powerful
    and attractive editor. However, you have to learn how to use it. I will
    describe my way to glow my vimrc in this part. The second part is to
    explain a case of my vimrc. It includes not only what
    options/plugins/scripts in vimrc are used but also why I introduce them.
    You can obtain some hints to step into Vim's wonder world after listening
    to this session.

    Introduces the tag stack, a useful feature for jumping between files using
    ctags and helptags. There is no problem even if ctags cannot be used or not
    supported. Since the tag stacks can be manipulated from Vim scripts, the
    same behavior can be implemented using LSP(Language Server protocol) etc.
    This talk will also explain how to manipulate the tag stack from Vim
    script.

   This talk describes testing of Vim.

   We can easily run the test of vim by typing `make test`, however, there
   might be few people who have actually run the test. In this session, I'd
   like to talk about how to run the test, how the test works and so on.
   Writing Vim's test will help you to understand Vim script deeply and reduce
   review time of PR.

    My presentation may be the last.  So I need to speak the development
    history.

    I have been developed Vim plugins over 10 years. I talk about my plugins
    development history and current development thoughts.

  bio: >-
    He is called as "Dark Vim master(暗黒美無王)" pronounced as
    "Uncock Vim Awe". He has developed popular Vim plugins over 10 years. He
    has sent some patches to Vim/neovim.

    He think text editor is everything in the world. He wants to do everything
    in Vim(neovim) like Emacs. It is not allowed by "design-not" in Vim. It is
    not the light way to use Vim. So he has defined it as the dark way. He is
    the dark Vimmer. His plugins are dark powered.
