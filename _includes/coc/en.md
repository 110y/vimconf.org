VimConf is an international conference series of community events for knowledge-sharing, communication, and collaboration, focusing mainly on technology.
(TODO: rewrite a paragraph)

Our prime goal is to provide events where all of the attendees can enjoy, and feel welcome to attend. To this end, we expect all who participate in our events to be courteous and be civil towards one another.

We ask that all participants including, but not limited to, the organizers and staff, speakers, exhibitors, and attendees to follow this Code of Conduct.


We welcome all participants. We do not tolerate harassment of any form. 

Be kind to others, and be mindful to the fact that there are participants from many different backgrounds, and that your casual actions may not be so to others. For this, we do not tolerate harassment of any form, including, but not limited to, sexual language and imagery at presentations, or sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes. 

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event or conference with no refund, or alerting local law officers.

If you or another participant has been subject to harassment, contact a VimConf staff nearby, or look for the appropriate contact page on the event in question, which they must clearly display. Reports will be handled anonymously unless local laws require disclosure, or both the organizers and the reporter and/or the person subjected to the harassment have agreed to disclosure.
